## Welcome to Right Track Windsurfing

There are not many things more distressing
 than watching a windsurfer newbie struggle 
on the wrong equipment. Buying the wrong equipment 
is not only expensive but it will also severely spoil
 your fun on the water Andrew I make progress a painfully slow  
process if not impossible. 

Part of the fun of learning to windsurf is learning 
all about the equipment. However nothing about
windsurfing is easy and it takes time and experience
 to understand all about the different board types, 
sail types,
board volumes, sail sizes, quivers,
booms, masts, harnesses and ... OMG there's so much to it! 


### Save money and progress faster
