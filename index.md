## Welcome to Right Track Windsurfing

There are not many things more distressing
 than watching a windsurfer newbie struggle 
on the wrong equipment. Buying the wrong equipment 
is not only an expensive mistake but it will also severely spoil
 your fun on the water and make progress a painfully slow  
process if not impossible. 

Part of the fun of learning to windsurf is learning 
all about the equipment. However not much about
windsurfing is easy and it takes time and experience
 to understand all about the different board types, 
sail types,
board volumes, sail sizes, quivers,
booms, masts, harnesses and ... OMG there's so much to it! 


### Save money and progress faster

Right Track Windsurfing will keep you on
the right track in the early years and help 
establish, guide and source your equipment needs 
from across all the different platforms. The equipment will be
optimised for your current level. 
Whatever your budget Right Track will know where to look 
and what to look for. You will also learn loads in the process.

### Cost
At present it's a free service but if we do
help you find equipment then a Little something
 will be very gratefully received :)
Get on board now 
and start receiving some windsurfing love?
